I am currently working in _________ at ____________. I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India, majoring in Mathematics and Computing.

My past work experience has been with Microsoft Research, India, where I was a research intern in the CISL (Cloud and Information Security Lab) division. There, I worked on the problem of issue detection in high dimensional time series data using sparse dictionarly learning and sparse coding techniques along with a technique based on clustering on subsets of attributes [1]. Before Microsoft, I remotely worked on a project with INCF (International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility) through Google Summer of Code 2014. The project's aim was to build a fast and accurate software for the real-time vectorization of brain atlases.
