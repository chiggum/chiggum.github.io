<p>I am a researcher in <strong>Advanced Technology Lab - Multimedia Division</strong> at <strong>Samsung Research Institute</strong>, <strong>Bangalore</strong>, <strong>India</strong>. Here, my work mainly concerns with building robust statistical models with better generalization across similar high-dimensional datasets for applications in the domain of computer vision and pattern recognition such as video summarization, object classification and action recognition. I obtained my <strong><a href="http://www.iitg.ernet.in/maths/acads/btech_struct.php">B.Tech degree in Mathematics and Computing</a></strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.iitg.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati</a></strong>.</p>

<p>My interests are broadly in the field of robust statistics, reasoning, attention and memory based machine learning models, reinforcement learning and spatio-temporal clustering. Currently, we are looking into developing deep hierarchical nonlinear models with high margin in the high-dimensional input space and with invariance to rigid-transformation as well as small deformation of the data and how well they generalize across similar datasets when the parameters are estimated using only a single dataset.</p>

<p>My past work experience has been with <strong>Microsoft Research</strong>, <strong>India</strong>, where I was a research intern in the CISL (Cloud and Information Services Lab) group. There, I worked on the problem of real-time detection of issues in high-dimensional performance counter time series data with the aim of detecting the time of the issue and the subset of counters which caused the issue.  Please check the <strong><a href="projects.html">projects</a></strong> page for more information.</p>

<p>Before Microsoft, I remotely worked on a project with <strong><a href="https://incf.org/">INCF</a></strong> through <strong><a href="https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2014">Google Summer of Code 2014</a></strong>. In this project, I developed a tracing software for the real-time vectorization of brain atlases. Here is a <strong><a href="https://chiggum.github.io/mindthegap">link</a></strong> to this project's page.</p>
