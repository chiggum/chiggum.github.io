<p>I obtained my <strong><a href="http://www.iitg.ernet.in/maths/acads/btech_struct.php">B.Tech degree in Mathematics and Computing</a></strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.iitg.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati</a></strong>.</p>

<p> I am currently trying to leverage the rich structure of theories from topological manifolds, algebraic curves, surfaces, and functional analysis, in building <i>robust and creative</i> models for analyzing data.</p>

<p>I recently worked as a researcher in <strong>Advanced Technology Lab - Multimedia Division</strong> at <strong>Samsung Research Institute</strong>, <strong>Bangalore</strong>, <strong>India</strong>. Here, I developed a Deep Hierarchical Network invariant to rotation of objects in the input image and extensively studied a technique based on contraction mappings to increase the lower bound on the margin in the input space of a non-linear classifier (in constrast to SVMs which maximize margin in the feature/kernel space). The motivation was to get high generalization across similar datasets when the parameters are estimated using only a single dataset. Also, I implemented video temporal segmentation as a core component of video summarization, based on Affinity Propagation and Sequential Determinantal Point Process. Please check the <strong><a href="publications.html">publications</a></strong> page for more information.</p>
        
<p>My past work experience has been with <strong>Microsoft Research</strong>, <strong>India</strong>, where I was a research intern in the CISL (Cloud and Information Services Lab) group. Here, I worked on the problem of real-time detection of issues in high-dimensional performance counter time series data with the aim of detecting the time of the issue and the subset of counters which caused the issue.  Please check the <strong><a href="projects.html">projects</a></strong> page for more information.</p>

<p>Before Microsoft, I remotely worked on a project with <strong><a href="https://incf.org/">INCF</a></strong> through <strong><a href="https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2014">Google Summer of Code 2014</a></strong>. In this project, I developed a tracing software for the real-time vectorization of brain atlases. Here is a <strong><a href="https://chiggum.github.io/mindthegap">link</a></strong> to this project's page.</p>
